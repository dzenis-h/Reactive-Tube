I'm sorry for the YouTube logo issue. I have replaced it with a red play button in this version:

# Reactive-Tube v 2.0 🎦

Reactive-Tube is a fun and simple app that uses the YouTube API to search and play videos. It was built with React and Redux as a way to practice and showcase these technologies. You can try it out [here](https://reactive-tube-2.web.app/). 😊

## Features 🚀

- Search for any video on YouTube using keywords 🔎
- Play the selected video on a custom player 🎥
- See related videos based on the current video 📺
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes 📱

## Installation 💻

To run this app locally, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You will also need to get your own YouTube API key from [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).

Clone this repo and navigate to the project folder. Then run the following commands:

```bash
npm install # install dependencies
npm start # start development server
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
